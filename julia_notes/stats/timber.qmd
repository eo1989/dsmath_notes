## Julia Quick Syntax (2E)

The following fictional database will be used throughout the notes.
```{julia}
using CSV
using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(region      = ["US", "US", "US", "US", "EU", "EU", "EU", "EU"],
               product     = ["Hardwood", "Hardwood", "Softwood", "Softwood", "Hardwood", "Hardwood", "Softwood", "Softwood"],
               year        = ["2010", "2020","2010", "2020","2010", "2020","2010", "2020"],
               production  = [3.3, 3.2, 2.3, 2.1, 2.7, 2.8, 1.5, 1.3],
               consumption = [4.3, 7.4, 2.5, 9.8, 3.2, 4.3, 6.5, 3.0]
              )

```
An empty df can be created via:
<!--df2 = DataFrame(A = Int64[], B = Float64[]) -->

To convert a df from a matrix of data, you must either pass a second parameter as a header name or use the `:auto` keyword:
```{julia}
mat = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
headers = ["c1", "c2", "c3"]
df2 = DataFrame(mat, :auto)  # by default col names are x1, x2, x3 ...
```

```{julia}
df2 = DataFrame(mat, headers)
```

Also possible to create a df from a table that is hard-coded:
```{julia}
using CSV
df2 = CSV.read(IOBuffer("""
region product   year  production  consumption
US     Hardwood  2010  3.3         4.3
US     Hardwood  2020  3.2         7.4
US     Softwood  2010  2.3         2.5
US     Softwood  2020  2.1         9.8
EU     Hardwood  2010  2.7         3.2
EU     Hardwood  2020  2.8         4.3
EU     Softwood  2010  1.5         6.5
EU     Softwood  2020  1.3         3.0
"""), DataFrame, delim = " ", ignorerepeated = true)
```


## Statistics with Julia

### Plots for single samples & time series

In the following example the TimeSeries package will carry out smoothing and compare two window size values, L = 7 (weekly) and L = 14 (fortnightly). This package contains a variety of more advanced time-series manipulation functions.

```{julia}
using DataFrames, CSV, Statistics, Dates, Plots, Measures; pyplot()
import ZipFile
```

Using temperature data from statswithjulia csv:
----------

```{julia}
data = CSV.read("../../../../Downloads/StatsWithJuliaBook-master/data/temperatures.csv")
```
