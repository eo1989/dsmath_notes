title: Consistency of Sample Mean
---

Assume that we have a random sample of size $n$ from a population with $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$. Lets investigate how the probability 
$\text{Pr}(\vert \bar X_{n} - \mu \vert > \epsilon)$ changes with respect to $n$ and $\epsilon$ and, when $\sigma^{2} = 4$.
::: {.notes}
That due to symmetry of normal distribution,
$$
\text{Pr}(\vert \bar X_{n} - \mu \vert > \epsilon) = \text{2Pr}(\mathrm{Z} > \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}) = 2\left(1- \Phi\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right)\right)
$$
